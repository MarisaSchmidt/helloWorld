Hi there! I am a recent Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and International Political Economics graduate from Fordham University, currently seeking internship or employment opportunities at tech startups. I have experience in programming, robotics, and product development. I am particularly interested in energy harvesting and storing, nano-electromechanical systems, and social-impact goods and services. I am eager to dive into the work force and am currently applying to take classes in physics to supplement work experience and expand my knowledge of innovative technologies.
